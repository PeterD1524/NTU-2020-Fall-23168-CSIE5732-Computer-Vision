###### Noise Removal
### Due Date: <span style="color:red">12/01</span>
### Description
Write a program which does:
 * (a) Generate noisy images with gaussian noise(amplitude of 10 and 30)
 * (b) Generate noisy images with salt-and-pepper noise( probability 0.1 and 0.05)
 * (c) Use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter on images generated by (a)(b)
 * (d) Use 3x3, 5x5 median filter on images generated by (a)(b)
 * (e) Use both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on images generated by (a)(b)
 * You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance(4 noisy images and 24 processed images)
### Announcement
 * You must include your noisy image before processing and after processing in your report.
 * You must calculate the [signal-to-ratio (SNR)](http://cv2.csie.ntu.edu.tw/CV/_material/snr.pdf) for each instance and write them in your report. Use this formula if any conflicts occur.
 * You are to generate gaussian noise with amplitude of 10 and 30, salt-and-pepper noise with probability 0.1 and 0.05. You must use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter and median filter, both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on those images. You will produce 24 images and 4 noise figures.
